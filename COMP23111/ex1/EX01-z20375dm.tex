\section{Comments/Assumptions}
My first assumption is that I assume the DRS is done correctly, but regardless
of that fact I thought this was a very straight forward task to complete. It
may have taken some time but I understand what I have created. The only part I 
may have some issues with is the division of entities. Other than that I feel 
sure of my work.
