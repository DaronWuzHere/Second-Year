Question 1
If you don't allocate enough memory during dynamic memory allocation, a 
"NULL" pointer might be returned. On the otherhand, you may get a "buffer
overflow", if your string is too big for the allocated memory.


Question 2
If you don't "free" the memory after allocating it then you might be using
more memory at runtime.
