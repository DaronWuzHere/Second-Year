Solving the 0/1 knapsack problem with the greedy algorithm is inefficient 
because it ignores other solutions of the problem, in which the items are 
placed in different orders. Though I do not believe it is the most optimal
solution for the fractional knapsack problem, it would still work better with it
than the 0/1.
