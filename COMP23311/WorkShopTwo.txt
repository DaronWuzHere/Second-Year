Workshop Two

Step one
The problem is that Xhiphin Zohos doesn't care if the water has been
checked to see if it has been clean or not be Stefan. I would guess the code 
that is supposed to ensure the water has to be checked, wasn't typed correctly
or is not present.

Step Two
The quest works correctly when the water is not the first item in your bag, but 
as soon as the water is moved to the first item slot, it is automatically 
taken by the Xhiphin Zohos.
