A clique is a subset of vertices in an undirected graph G =(V, E), where every
two vertices in that clique is adjacent.
 
This allows the subset of vertices to be a complete graph. The maximum clique in
any undirected graph is the largest clique in the graph. 

Since cliques are adjacent to two vertices, each vertex in the clique must have 
a distinct colour.Therefore knowing the size of the maximal clique allows for
smallest k such that a graph is k-colourable.

The Maximal Clique Problem occurs when there is an undirected graph with 
multiple cliques, when a new vertex is added, the number of total cliques that 
must be searched doubles.

This causes an exponentially growing problem, where the most effecient algorithm
that solves this problem runs in O(1.188^n), but that is the best upper bound.

The lower bound would not be a polynomial one, otherwise P=NP would be solved.

This is related to a graph's colourability because there are instances where a
node needs to be added to a graph, which could cause the size of the maximum 
node to increase, which then gives us a reason to search for the maximum node
again.
