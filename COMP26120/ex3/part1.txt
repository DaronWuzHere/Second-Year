 0x00007ffff7aaf716 in __strcpy_sse2_unaligned () from /lib64/libc.so.6

This was the error found. I assume it means that it the memory address used in 
"strcpy" had no space.

I added a "malloc" statement before the "strcpy" statement inorder to allow 
space.

The program now returns a null statement in the space of "work.second".

I did have some problems using "break" and "watchpoint", this caused me to not 
figure out the rest.
