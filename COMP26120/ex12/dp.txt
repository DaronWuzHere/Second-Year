Three properties of the knapsack problem are:

1. Simple Subproblems
The simple subproblems are the additions of the items to be added into the
"knapsack" and the comparisons that take place inorder to find solutions that 
fit the items in the "knapsack".

2. Subproblem Optimality
Subproblem optimality is finding the best solution from the set of subproblems,
which is basically finding the solution which is the combination of the highest
weight and the highest value.

3. Subproblem Overlap
Some subproblems may contain similar solutions to other subproblems but this is 
why it is important to find best solution.
